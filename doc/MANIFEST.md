# Goals
<!-- Becometh: 
1. Champion of C 
2. Master of Markdown
3. Graphical guru
4. CEO of compiling

Enabing me to: 
1. Pivot to a wider variety of software gigs
2. Do some amatuer game dev
3. Make brain bigger
4. Overcome fear of curly braces
5. Flex software not written in python
6. Increase the number of tools in my engineering Swiss Army Knife
-->
- Build skills that I don't get develop in my job (RF and Python)
  - to make switching to a software gig natural and require no hierarchical steps backwards
  - become more independent in cross-team activities
- Get back into the habit of being productive outside of work
- I'm too passionate about video gaming and have sunk far too much time into it - attaining the skills for developing video games could lead to an immensely productive passion

# The TODO list

Skills/techs I will get better with:
- C, maybe some C++
- CMake
- Project file structuring

Things I will learn from scratch/relearn:
- OpenGL
- GLFW, GLEW, or idk graphical stuff in C is foreign to me
- Git or some other CI
- Data Oriented Programming
  - Learn when each is appropriate
- Utilizing cache memory effectively
- De-assembling code
- Run-time debugging in C
- Pybind11 or equivelent python <-> c binding tech if there is a genuine reason for me to persue this

**_Stretchiest_** goals
- If I can somehow make use of one of my FPGA dev kis in this, sick bro madlad.  Feedback loops can be much simpler and more efficient here, so there is a case.
