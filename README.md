# My C Sandbox
Been a while since I've done an up-skill grind, and I should probably spend less of my free time playing Runescape.
I learned the basics of C in my Electrical Engineering degree, but I haven't really touched the language since 2017.
This repo will document my re-learning of C, learning a bunch of things I haven't had time for, and showing any cool stuff I make along the way.

## Dependencies

Developing this all on some form of linux, although it seems to change from week to week on this 10 year old laptop.
Currently running arch-based EndeavourOS and using `gcc` (version 11.1.0) to compile , so here are all the pacman installs.

```bash
sudo pacman -S glew freeglut
```
