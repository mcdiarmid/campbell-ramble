# My C Sandbox
Been a while since I've done an up-skill grind, and I should probably spend less of my free time playing Runescape.
I learned the basics of C in my Electrical Engineering degree, but I haven't really touched the language since 2017.
This repo will document my re-learning of C, learning a bunch of things I haven't had time for, and showing any cool stuff I make along the way.
